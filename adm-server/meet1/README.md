This directory replaces the previous `meet1.md` file.

Add your meeting notes, slides, or other materials here, for example:

- `notes.md` — meeting notes
- `slides.pdf` — slides

(Originally `adm-server/meet1.md` was pushed as a single file; it has been replaced by this folder so you can organize multiple files.)
